# Polytopes for music segmentation #

Polytopic paradigms to study music, based on [1] and [2].

In near future, I should upload my own reference, detailing the specificity of both approaches of [1] and [2], which have been gathered on a same framework and on a same code project (this one).

The goal of the polytopic approach is to define a new compression criteria, then used as cost for music segmentation, based on dynamic programming. See [3] or [4] for more details on this approach.
