    "In this work, polytopes are geometrical objects (n-dimensional hypercubes with possible alteration), which support musical elements on their vertices, and link them by edges. In general (at least for now), musical elements are major or minor chords, discretized on a temporal index (beats or upbeats typically). An example of polytope is presented on the figure below.\n",

    "## Irregular polytopes and patterns\n",
    "In the previous part, we presented regular polytopes and patterns, *i.e.* n-dimensional hypercubes. In our model, they represent the core of polytopes, but not the entire story. Indeed, as presented by C. Guichaoua in [1], polytopes are extended by adding and/or deleting some vertices to a n-dimensional hypercubes. The alteration (both addition and deletion) follow the vertices of a m-dimensional polytope, with $m < n - 1$. In that sense, every polytope is a n-dimensional polytope on which some vertices may be deleted, and some other may be added, following the shape of another hypercube. In the case of both addition and deletion, the dimensions of their respective polytopic shape can be of different dimensions. When some vertices are involved with both an addition and a deletion, the deletion has higher priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "To represent a deletion in a pattern, we simply delete the involved elements. For example, the pattern associated with the deletion of an element in a dimension 1 polytope is \"[1]\" (not to confuse with references), and the deletion of the last dim-1 polytope in a dim-3 polytope would be: [[[1,1],[1,1]],[[1,1]]]. (NB: a void dim-1 polytope ([]) will not be displayed).\n",
    "\n",
    "An addition will be represented by the tuple at the position of the addition, where the first element of the tuple will be the element originally present in the polytope, and the second one will be the added element. In that sense, the pattern associated with the addition of an element in a dimension 1 polytope is \"[1, (1,1)]\", and the addition of a dim-1 polytope in a dim-3 polytope would be: [[[1,1],[1,1]],[[1,1],[(1,1),(1,1)]]]."
